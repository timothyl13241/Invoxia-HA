# Invoxia-HA

This Invoxia tracker integration was originally written by @ezlo-picori which can be found here: [
ezlo-picori:gpstracker-integration](https://github.com/ezlo-picori/core/tree/gpstracker-integration) and the specific pull request [here](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/63671).

I have re-packaged it as a custom_component integration.
